### Hi, I'm Emil ðŸ‘‹
Currently deep into web development after building my first project "Top XYZ" in Go. I love the simplicity of the language and how good the standard library is.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go, JavaScript or Python. I'd especially love to work in a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
