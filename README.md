### Hi, I'm Emil ðŸ‘‹

I like doing web stuff with a preference for the backend. I recently created an app called [Top XYZ](https://topxyz.net)
 where you can create a top list for anything. It helps you to keep track of your personal favorites, enables you to rank them, and sharing them with others.

I'm also experienced with web automation using tools such as PuppeteerJS to create web scrapers and automate tedious tasks.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go, JavaScript or Python. I'd especially love to work in a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
