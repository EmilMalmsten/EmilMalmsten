### Hi, I'm Emil ðŸ‘‹

I like doing web stuff. Mostly on the backend. I recently learned Golang and quickly became a fan. I especially like the simplicity, the standard library, and the crazy fast build times.

I've created an app called Top XYZ (https://topxyz.net) where you can create a top list for anything. It helps you to keep track of your personal favorites, enables you to rank them, and sharing them with others. I used Go on the backend for that project which really helped me boost my skills in Go and just REST API related tech in general.

I'm also quite experienced with web automation and tools such as Puppeteer to create web scrapers. It's really cool and satisfying to see them perform tedious and repetitive tasks.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go, JavaScript or Python. I'd especially love to work in a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
